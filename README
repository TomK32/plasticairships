== Welcome to plasticairships

every pilot needs a plane, err... airship.

=== History
Plasticairship is the software that runs plasticpilots.com, a website and community about design
that is online since 2002 and after a new owner came took over in 2008 it received a relaunch.
Before, plasticpilots was running expression engine, but the new owner is a rails-addict as
well as a open source fan-boy. Developing the software for your websites in open source
or even public domain is definitely one of the best things to do and you might want to do it
as well. Just think of a Mediawiki or Wordpress.

=== What it does
The main features of plasticairships are a blog, showcases (only websites for now), and in
near future some upload functionality (in the special case of plasticpilots with will be open content vector graphic, think OCAL, just more sophisticated)

=== Version History
